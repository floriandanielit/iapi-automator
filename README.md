iapi-automator
==============

The goal of this project is to develop a **programmable web service that is able to mimic
user interactions with [iAPIs](http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/)**.
The service extends the [in-browser engine for interactive APIs](https://github.com/floriandanielit/interactive-apis)
with support for long-running and stateful interactions with Web pages, such as filling
forms that span multiple pages or multi-page navigations.

All software of the project is **free and open-source**, as specified by the terms 
of the [BSD license](https://github.com/floriandanielit/iapi-automator/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).


iAPI reference specification
----------
The implementation of this service is based on [iAPI HTML annotation format]
(http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/wiki/Main_Page). The specification is developed and 
maintained by the [W3C Interactive APIs Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/).
The Group is open, participation is free, and contributions are welcome from everyone.
